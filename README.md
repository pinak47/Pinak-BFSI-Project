# Pinak-BFSI-Project

## Business problem: A leading life insurance company wants to predict the bonus for its agents sothat it comes up with two categories of agents one may be extraordinary performer, other one is low performer Based on those categories,company may design appropriate engagement activity for their highperforming agents and upskill programs for low performing agents.

### The project activities were divided into several parts such as EDA, Feature modelling, Model building, Model performance measure, Insights and final business recommendation.

### Few ML models were evaluated on the dataset such as Linear regression, decision tree, ANN, random forest, XGBoost, LGBM with hyper parameter optimization. 

### Performance matrices such as R2 score and RMSE were used for model evaluation on train and test dataset.

### FInally based on the best model, the agent bonus was predicted and with a defined cut-off, the agents were catagorized as "High performing" and "Average performing".

## Several insights/recommendations are reported to the company to motivate the low performimg agents and further enhance the performance of "high performing" agents.
